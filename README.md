Updated to use `robot` as the defautl robot runner - `pybot` is no longer supported.

Tried this first, but is unmaintained: https://github.com/sakari/robot-mode

The bigger problem, I wasn't able to save a buffer in robot mode.

Just want a little color and shortcuts to run tests for now.

Borrowed `robot-font-lock-keywords` from sakari/robot-mode and combined with test runner shortcuts similar to
https://github.com/dougm/bats-mode and https://github.com/nlamirault/gotest.el
